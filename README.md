# Cat Identification Using Deep Learning

Cat Detector is a deep learning project designed to determine whether a cat is present in a given image. This project focuses solely on the model, with no backend or frontend integration. After training the model on images, users can test their own images to detect the presence of a cat.

## Features

- **Cat Detection:** Identifies if a cat is present in any given image.
- **Simple Image Processing:** Uses a trained deep learning model to make predictions on images.
- **No Backend/Frontend:** A lightweight solution focused solely on the deep learning model and image testing.


## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Python Libraries**
    - NumPy: For matrix operations and numerical computations.
    - Image (Pillow): For image processing and handling.


## Installation

- Install my-project with npm

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cat-detector.git
cd cat-detector
```
- Install required libraries:
```bash
pip install numpy Image
```
